A binary file is a computer file that is not a text file. The term "binary file" is often used as a term meaning "non-text file".Many binary file formats contain parts that can be interpreted as text; for example, some computer document files containing formatted text, such as older Microsoft Word document files, contain the text of the document but also contain formatting information in binary form.
